# Energy-usage-with-pandas

The goal of this project was to educate myself a bit on a few things:
- Using and manipulating excel data with Python
- Using Pandas to load and manipulate DataFrames
- Using matplotlib to visualize data from Pandas

# Findings

- For the purpose of this project, using Pandas to maniplate excel was quite easy.  Not sure if there might be more difficult situations where a more robust library might be needed.
- Using Pandas itself was very intuitive.  It is one of those things that is easy to learn and difficult to master.
- I didn't include the raw data because the spreadsheet came from another website and I don't want to post something that is not mine into this repo
- Matplotlib seems interesting for basic visualization.  Doesn't seem like you would want to use this for professional grade presentations.  That being said, it is a great way to look at data in different ways.
